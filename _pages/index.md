## Introduction

## Workshop Rules
 - Rule No. 1: This is a workshop, not a talk
 - Rule No. 2: Feel free to whisper, but please keep noise to a minimum!
 - Rule No. 3: Feel free to work on exercises / reading at any point
 - Rule No. 4: If you're totally lost, please say so during the exercise breaks. That's my fault!
               We'll be making use of everything covered today in the practical.
 - Rule No. 5: Please observe the university [Code of Conduct](http://www.docs.sasg.ed.ac.uk/AcademicServices/Discipline/StudentCodeofConduct.pdf) during the workshop. We're here to enjoy ourselves and (hopefully!) learn about operating systems. Any threatening or offensive behaviour or language will be treated seriously.

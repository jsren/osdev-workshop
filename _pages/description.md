# The OSDev Workshop

This student-run workshop will focus on all of the things you actually
need to know about operating systems, giving you practical experience and
real-world knowledge useful across many different techologies.

Despite what the OS course here might suggest, hobby operating systems
are one of the most interesting and impressive projects you can work on.
They give you a set of unique challenges to overcome, and huge amounts of
useful knowledge on how everything works behind the scenes.

### Not Covered

 - Types of scheduling algorithms
 - Page replacement algorithms
 - TAR file format
 - Boring/confusing slides, "The X Problem" and unnessary shorthand notation

   * The x86 Processor

- Teaches real-world skills
   * Gives background crucial for high-performance coding
   * Gives background crucial for security
   * Low-level programming
   * Driver development and working with hardware
   * Debug kernel issues, system calls
   * Strong understanding of how OSes work
   * Understanding of how programs are executed
   * Learn more about x86 processors than you ever thought
     you would need
   * Provides supplementary materials covering x86 assembly,
     BIOS and everything you need to know to write bootloaders
